# Povio Labs Android Assignment

### FlowrSpot Project

## Assignment Info

You are going to make a working Android version of a product called FlowrSpot. It is used for
flower spotting while hiking, traveling etc. Users can check out different flowers, their details and
sightings as well as add their sightings.
You will not need to implement the whole product. You can check what must be implemented to
complete the assignment in the section ? _Requirements?_. The assignment usually takes around a
single workday.

## Project Designs and Assets

The project design is hosted on ?Figma?. All the
elements should be in the same scale as on
Zeplin. The font used for the project is ?Ubuntu?.
You can find the API documentation at
https://flowrspot-api.herokuapp.com/doc?.


## Instructions

The goal is to create an app that not only functions well but is also easily maintainable and
upgradable. Be mindful of the libraries you choose to use (you should be able to justify their use).
This app should represent your level of expertise and we trust that you will solve it yourself. You
should be able to explain the decisions that you made while planning and developing this app.

## Clarifications
